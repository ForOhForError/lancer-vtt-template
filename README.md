# lancer-vtt-template
An opinionated starting point for a LANCER RPG world for Foundry VTT

Comes with a set of modules and configuration to provide a usable (roughly) out of the box setup for running combat smoothly.

## Usage

* Install the [LANCER system](https://github.com/Eranziel/foundryvtt-lancer/). You may need to install a beta release in order to use the system on the latest version of Foundry.

* From Foundry's setup page, click the "Install World" button. Paste ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ForOhForError/lancer-vtt-template/main/world.json``` 
into the "Manifest URL" textbox, and click install. Click yes on any popups about installing dependencies.

* Click the "Edit World" button next to the world "LANCER Template" to set the name, background image, and description of the template to your liking.

* Launch the world and login as Gamemaster.

* If you are running a beta version of the LANCER system, accept the beta testing agreement.

* Load the LANCER core files, either from the prompt that appears, or from the LANCER compendium manager in the Compendium tab.

* Load up any additional LCPs (Lancer Content Packs) you'll want as well. As a GM, the minimum you'll want is the LANCER NPC data file included with your corebook purchase.
Several of the modules available from [Massif Press's itch.io page](https://massif-press.itch.io/) have these packs available, with player-facing content available as free downloads.

* In the settings tab, click "Manage Modules". Enable the module "Forien's Copy Environment" and click "Save Module Settings".

* Download the [foundry-settings-export](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ForOhForError/lancer-vtt-template/main/foundry-settings-export.json) file from this repository.

* In the settings tab, right-click the area under "General Information", select "Import Settings" from the menu, and choose the file from the previous step.

* The template world will now have the correct settings enabled.
